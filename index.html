            <h3>Programmer</h3>
            <p class="programmer-skill-desc">Programming is a recent passion of mine. I started my journey a few years back during the start of the pandemic and immediately fell in love. During my journey, I picked up the principles of Object-Oriented Programming and languages like C#, Python and Java. I also have some experience in SQL, HTML, CSS and Javascript.</p>

            <h3>Process Manager</h3>
            <p class="process-manager-desc">Currently, I work as Process Manager. I am BPM (Business Process Management) certified. I monitor and maintain business process controls and work horizontally across my organization to address breaks in the process. I've used the skills that I've picked up as a programmer to build my own tools to assist me in monitoring process activities.</p>

            <h3>Improvisor</h3>
            <p class="improv-desc">Improv? On a programmer's website? It's not as odd as you might think. Just as I have a passion for solving problems, I also have one for storytelling and humor. Improv is a way for me to tell stories on a blank canvas, in an environment where failure is embraced. It trains me to make descisions quickly, and when something doesn't work I can accept that and try something different. Improv is one the earliest forms of test & learn out there. </p>
